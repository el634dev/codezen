## Setup
The requirements for this project are simple and do not require much setup. You will need a code editor of your choice. I use VSCode because Flask is supported, which makes setup easier. There are no dependencies, only additional plugins if you would like to set them up. If you are unsure, then I would say Prettier+ and a Python linter are a good start. You can get all the plugins in VSCode in the side menu, it looks like blocks. You can add the Poke API which you can find by searching for it in your browser. To sum everything up, all you need is a code editor and a plugin to allow you to see your website.

## Usage
How does one go about using it?

`User navigates onto the home page and can click any buttons or use the navigation links in the header(top of the page) or footer(bottom of the page).`
`User can also view the website on mulitple devices such as desktop or mobile.`
